# PIG-DICE
By Elias Kanoga Ndegwa
This is an app game whereby a player has to follow certain rules in playing.The game implementation is a single player game against another  player. This rules are:
               - Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
               - If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
               - If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
               - If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
               - The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
